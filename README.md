# NROL-39-Wallpaper
An 8k wallpaper derived from the [NROL-39 Mission Patch](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NROL_39_vector_logo.svg), released by the United States National Reconisance office by [Freedom of information act request](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/nrol-39-mission-logo-78740/#file-817846).

I created it by taking the SVG form and putting it on a black background in Krita.
